added viewBox="0 0 {original-width} {original-height}"
remove width, set height to 100% ((width: "auto" is invalid. it probably defaults to the same thing as removing it.))
svg is now controlled by height of container
container is already present in Logo, so don't need to added

if a height is supplied to Logo, it will be passed to the container. Otherwise, a container height of 100% will be used.
This container can be put inside another container if required for some reason (?)
